# Helper to randomly pick some code to read

Inspired by Adam Wo≈Çk's blogpost about reading BSD code daily.

The idea is to pick a project (or a few) and read at least one source code file
a day for educational purposes. He chose BSD's base system and userland, I have
chosen the Linux kernel and some GNU system utilities.

Which projects will you chose?
